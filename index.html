        <h3>I started dancing at the age of 4, and my parents sent me to learn dancing to build confidence, but i also started to like dancing. I really enjoy dancing as i can express myself in an artform.

            I first learn sketching at school thn later in classes. I have been learning it for 2 years. I usually sketch humans and anime characters.
